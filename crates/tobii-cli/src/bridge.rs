//! `tobii bridge` — put the Wine-side bridge into a game's prefix.
//!
//! # The thing that was easy to get wrong, and how it stopped mattering
//!
//! A Wine prefix is served by a `wineserver`, and named kernel objects like
//! `FT_SharedMem` live inside one server's session. The bridge used to be a
//! separate `tobii-bridge.exe` you left running, and launching it with
//! `/usr/bin/wine` against a prefix whose game runs under a bundled runner gave
//! you a *second* wineserver: the bridge started, said everything worked,
//! created its mapping — and the game never saw it, because it was looking at a
//! different session's namespace. Nothing about that failure pointed at its
//! cause, and for a Steam/Proton title it was not a mistake but the only
//! possible outcome, short of reproducing Proton's whole launch environment.
//!
//! The receive loop lives in the client DLL now, inside the game's own process,
//! so the sessions match by construction and there is nothing to leave running.
//! See `tobii_bridge_core::feeder`.
//!
//! **Which `wine` binary still matters here**, for two narrower reasons:
//!
//! * Writing the registry. A prefix records the version that built it, and a
//!   different wine touching it runs `wineboot -u` and upgrades it — so using
//!   the system wine to write two values could rewrite a Proton prefix out from
//!   under the game that owns it. Steam records the answer in the prefix's own
//!   `config_info`, and that is what [`wine_from_steam_config_info`] reads.
//! * The one remaining case that needs `tobii bridge run`: a TrackIR game
//!   pointed at a third-party client DLL. That DLL is a pure consumer of
//!   `FT_SharedMem`, and a TrackIR-only game never loads ours — so something
//!   must fill the mapping, in the game's own session.
